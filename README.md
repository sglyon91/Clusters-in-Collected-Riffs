# Clusters-in-Collected-Riffs

In this project, I collect various music samples I've recorded; transform the audio files into manipulatable data; cluster the samples using KMeans, Spectral Clustering, and Gaussian mixture models; pick the best method and cluster size using the Silhouette Score; and then use various methods of analysis to investigate the chosen model.
